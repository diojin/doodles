/**
 * Listing 7.5. Using Interruption for Cancellation.<br><br>
 * 
 * BrokenPrimeProducer can be easily fixed (and simplified) by using interruption instead of a boolean flag 
 * to request cancellation, as shown in Listing 7.5. There are two points in each loop iteration 
 * where interruption may be detected: in the blocking put call, and by explicitly polling the interrupted status 
 * in the loop header. The explicit test is not strictly necessary here because of the blocking put call, 
 * but it makes PrimeProducer more responsive to interruption because it checks for interruption 
 * before starting the lengthy task of searching for a prime, rather than after. When calls to interruptible blocking 
 * methods are not frequent enough to deliver the desired responsiveness, explicitly testing the 
 * interrupted status can help.
